        <h1>HTML5 Methods for Making Things Tab-able</h1>

        <p>All of the items below are tabbable. The text area and button are tabbable by default, and the divs use two different methods.</p>
        
        <textarea tabindex="1">A textarea. Focus states work by default.</textarea>
        <button tabindex="2">And I'm a button. Again, works by default.</button>
        <div contenteditable tabindex="3">Divs don't usually have a focus state. But I'm special, because I'm <code>contenteditable</code>.</div>
        <div tabindex="4">I'm another div, and I have a <code>tabindex</code>. You can't edit me like the div above, but you can tab to me.</div>
        <textarea tabindex="-1">I can't be tabbed to. This is a terrible idea, generally, but it can be done using tabindex="-1". Notice that (if you click) I still have a focus state, even though you can't tab to me.</textarea>
    </body>
