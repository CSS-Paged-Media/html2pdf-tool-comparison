<p><a name="p5" id="p5"></a>The World Wide Web uses relatively
simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and
utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space
of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and
media. In an effort to preserve these properties of the information
space as the technologies evolve, this architecture document
discusses the core design components of the Web. They are
identification of resources, representation of resource state, and
the protocols that support the interaction between agents and
resources in the space. We relate core design components,
constraints, and good practices to the principles and properties
they support.</p>

space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are
identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource
Identifiers (<a name="def-uri-acronym" id=

<p><a name="p13" id="p13"></a> <span class=

<div class="story">
<p><a name="p14" id="p14"></a>While planning a trip to Mexico,
Nadia reads “Oaxaca weather information:
'http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'” in a glossy travel magazine.
Nadia has enough experience with the Web to recognize that
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" is a URI and that she is likely
to be able to retrieve associated information with her Web browser.
When Nadia enters the URI into her browser:</p>

<ol>
<li>The browser recognizes that what Nadia typed is a URI.</li>
<li>The browser performs an information retrieval action in
accordance with its configured behavior for resources identified
via the "http" URI scheme.</li>
<li>The authority responsible for "weather.example.com" provides
information in a response to the retrieval request.</li>
<li>The browser interprets the response, identified as XHTML by the
server, and performs additional retrieval actions for inline
graphics and other content as necessary.</li>
<li>The browser displays the retrieved information, which includes
hypertext links to other information. Nadia can follow these
hypertext links to retrieve additional information.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="p15" id="p15"></a>This scenario illustrates the three
architectural bases of the Web that are discussed in this
document:</p>
<ol>

<li>
<p><a name="p16" id="p16"></a><a class="int" href="#identification" shape=
"rect">Identification (§2)</a>. URIs are used to identify
resources. In this travel scenario, the resource is a periodically
updated report on the weather in Oaxaca, and the URI is
“http://weather.example.com/oaxaca”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="p17" id="p17"></a><a class="int" href="#interaction" shape=
"rect">Interaction (§3)</a>. Web agents communicate using
standardized protocols that enable interaction through the exchange
of messages which adhere to a defined syntax and semantics. By
entering a URI into a retrieval dialog or selecting a hypertext
link, Nadia tells her browser to perform a retrieval action for the
resource identified by the URI. In this example, the browser sends
an HTTP GET request (part of the HTTP protocol) to the server at
"weather.example.com", via TCP/IP port 80, and the server sends
back a message containing what it determines to be a representation
of the resource as of the time that representation was generated.
Note that this example is specific to hypertext browsing of
information—other kinds of interaction are possible, both within
browsers and through the use of other types of Web agent; our
example is intended to illustrate one common interaction, not
define the range of possible interactions or limit the ways in
which agents might use the Web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="p18" id="p18"></a><a class="int" href="#formats" shape=
"rect">Formats (§4)</a>. Most protocols used for representation
retrieval and/or submission make use of a sequence of one or more
messages, which taken together contain a payload of representation
data and metadata, to transfer the representation between agents.
The choice of interaction protocol places limits on the formats of
representation data and metadata that can be transmitted. HTTP, for
example, typically transmits a single octet stream plus metadata,
and uses the "Content-Type" and "Content-Encoding" header fields to
further identify the format of the representation. In this
scenario, the representation transferred is in XHTML, as identified
by the "Content-type" HTTP header field containing the registered
Internet media type name, "application/xhtml+xml". That Internet
media type name indicates that the representation data can be
processed according to the XHTML specification.</p>
<p><a name="p19" id="p19"></a>Nadia's browser is configured and
programmed to interpret the receipt of an "application/xhtml+xml"
typed representation as an instruction to render the content of
that representation according to the XHTML rendering model,
including any subsidiary interactions (such as requests for
external style sheets or in-line images) called for by the
representation. In the scenario, the XHTML representation data
received from the initial request instructs Nadia's browser to also
retrieve and render in-line the weather maps, each identified by a
URI and thus causing an additional retrieval action, resulting in
additional representations that are processed by the browser
according to their own data formats (e.g., "application/svg+xml"
indicates the SVG data format), and this process continues until
all of the data formats have been rendered. The result of all of
this processing, once the browser has reached an application
steady-state that completes Nadia's initial requested action, is
commonly referred to as a "Web page".</p>

this Document</a></h4>
<p><a name="p28" id="p28"></a>This document presents the general
architecture of the Web. Other groups inside and outside W3C also
address specialized aspects of Web architecture, including
accessibility, quality assurance, internationalization, device
independence, and Web Services. The section on <a class="int" href="#archspecs"
shape="rect">Architectural Specifications (§7.1)</a> includes
references to these related specifications.</p>
<p><a name="p29" id="p29"></a>This document strives for a balance
between brevity and precision while including illustrative
examples. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/findings" shape=
"rect">TAG findings</a> are informational documents that complement
the current document by providing more detail about selected
topics. This document includes some excerpts from the findings.
Since the findings evolve independently, this document includes
references to approved TAG findings. For other TAG issues covered
by this document but without an approved finding, references are to
entries in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html"

<p><a name="p30" id="p30"></a>Many of the examples in this document
that involve human activity suppose the familiar Web interaction
model (illustrated at the beginning of the Introduction) where a
person follows a link via a user agent, the user agent retrieves
and presents data, the user follows another link, etc. This
document does not discuss in any detail other interaction models
such as voice browsing (see, for example, [<a class="int" href="#VOICEXML2"
shape="rect">VOICEXML2</a>]). The choice of interaction model may
have an impact on expected agent behavior. For instance, when a
graphical user agent running on a laptop computer or hand-held
device encounters an error, the user agent can report errors
directly to the user through visual and audio cues, and present the
user with options for resolving the errors. On the other hand, when
someone is browsing the Web through voice input and audio-only
output, stopping the dialog to wait for user input may reduce
usability since it is so easy to "lose one's place" when browsing
with only audio-output. This document does not discuss how the
principles, constraints, and good practices identified here apply
in all interaction contexts.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="cat-principle" id="cat-principle" shape=

<dd>An architectural principle is a fundamental rule that applies
to a large number of situations and variables. Architectural
principles include "separation of concerns", "generic interface",
"self-descriptive syntax," "visible semantics," "network effect"
(Metcalfe's Law), and Amdahl's Law: "The speed of a system is
limited by its slowest component."</dd>
<dt><a name="cat-constraint" id="cat-constraint" shape=

<dd>In the design of the Web, some choices, like the names of the
<code>p</code> and <code>li</code> elements in HTML, the choice of
the colon (:) character in URIs, or grouping bits into eight-bit
units (octets), are somewhat arbitrary; if <code>paragraph</code>
had been chosen instead of <code>p</code> or asterisk (*) instead
of colon, the large-scale result would, most likely, have been the
same. This document focuses on more fundamental design choices:
design choices that lead to constraints, i.e., restrictions in
behavior or interaction within the system. Constraints may be
imposed for technical, policy, or other reasons to achieve
desirable properties in the system, such as accessibility, global
scope, relative ease of evolution, efficiency, and dynamic
extensibility.</dd>

<h2>2. <a name="identification" id="identification" shape=
"rect">Identification</a></h2>
<p><a name="p32" id="p32"></a>In order to communicate internally, a
community agrees (to a reasonable extent) on a set of terms and
their meanings. One goal of the Web, since its inception, has been
to build a global community in which any party can share
information with any other party. To achieve this goal, the Web
makes use of a single global identification system: the URI. URIs
are a cornerstone of Web architecture, providing identification
that is common across the Web. The global scope of URIs promotes
large-scale "network effects": the value of an identifier increases
the more it is used consistently (for example, the more it is used
in <a class="addrefnb" href="#hypertext" shape="rect">hypertext
links (§4.4)</a>).</p>

<p class="principle"><a name="p34" id="p34"></a> Global naming

</div>
<p><a name="p35" id="p35"></a>This principle dates back at least as

<h3>2.1. <a name="uri-benefits" id="uri-benefits" shape=
"rect">Benefits of URIs</a></h3>
<p><a name="p36" id="p36"></a>The choice of syntax for global
identifiers is somewhat arbitrary; it is their global scope that is
important. The <a name="def-uri" id="def-uri"><dfn>Uniform Resource
Identifier</dfn></a>, [<a class="int" href="#URI" shape="rect">URI</a>], has
been successfully deployed since the creation of the Web. There are
substantial benefits to participating in the existing network of
URIs, including linking, bookmarking, caching, and indexing by
search engines, and there are substantial costs to creating a new
identification system that has the same properties as URIs.</p>

practice: <a name="pr-use-uris" id="pr-use-uris" shape=

<p class="practice"><a name="p38" id="p38"></a> To benefit from and
increase the value of the World Wide Web, agents should provide
URIs as identifiers for resources.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p39" id="p39"></a>A resource should have an associated
URI if another party might reasonably want to create a hypertext
link to it, make or refute assertions about it, retrieve or cache a
representation of it, include all or part of it by reference into
another representation, annotate it, or perform other operations on
it. Software developers should expect that sharing URIs across
applications will be useful, even if that utility is not initially
evident. The TAG finding <cite>"<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html" shape=
"rect">URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and
POST</a>"</cite> discusses additional benefits and considerations
of URI addressability.</p>
<p><a name="p40" id="p40"></a><strong>Note:</strong> Some URI
schemes (such as the "ftp" URI scheme specification) use the term
"designate" where this document uses "identify."</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h3>2.2. <a name="id-resources" id="id-resources" shape=
"rect">URI/Resource Relationships</a></h3>
<p><a name="p41" id="p41"></a>By design a URI identifies one
resource. We do not limit the scope of what might be a <a name=
"def-resource" id="def-resource"><dfn>resource</dfn></a>. The term
"resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
identified by a URI. It is conventional on the hypertext Web to
describe Web pages, images, product catalogs, etc. as “resources”.
The distinguishing characteristic of these resources is that all of
their essential characteristics can be conveyed in a message. We
identify this set as “<a name="def-information-resource" id=
"def-information-resource"><dfn>information
resources</dfn></a>.”</p>
<p><a name="p42" id="p42"></a>This document is an example of an
information resource. It consists of words and punctuation symbols
and graphics and other artifacts that can be encoded, with varying
degrees of fidelity, into a sequence of bits. There is nothing
about the essential information content of this document that
cannot in principle be transfered in a message. In the case of this
document, the message payload is the <a class="int" href="#def-representation"
shape="rect">representation</a> of this document.</p>
<p><a name="p43" id="p43"></a>However, our use of the term resource
is intentionally more broad. Other things, such as cars and dogs
(and, if you've printed this document on physical sheets of paper,
the artifact that you are holding in your hand), are resources too.
They are not information resources, however, because their essence
is not information. Although it is possible to describe a great
many things about a car or a dog in a sequence of bits, the sum of
those things will invariably be an approximation of the essential
character of the resource.</p>

<p><a name="p44" id="p44"></a>We define the term “information
resource” because we observe that it is useful in discussions of
Web technology and may be useful in constructing specifications for
facilities built for use on the Web.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><a name="p45" id="p45"></a> <span class=
"constraintlab">Constraint: <a name="pr-uri-collision" id=
"pr-uri-collision" shape="rect">URIs Identify a Single
Resource</a></span></p>
<p class="constraint"><a name="p46" id="p46"></a> Assign distinct
URIs to distinct resources.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p47" id="p47"></a>Since the scope of a URI is global,
the resource identified by a URI does not depend on the context in
which the URI appears (see also the section about <a class=
"section" href="#indirect-identification" shape="rect">indirect
identification (§2.2.3)</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p48" id="p48"></a>[<a class="int" href="#URI" shape="rect">URI</a>]
is an agreement about how the Internet community allocates names
and associates them with the resources they identify. URIs are
divided into <a class="int" href="#URI-scheme" shape="rect">schemes (§2.4)</a>

that define, via their scheme specification, the mechanism by which
scheme-specific identifiers are associated with resources. For
example, the "http" URI scheme ([<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape=
"rect">RFC2616</a>]) uses DNS and TCP-based HTTP servers for the
purpose of identifier allocation and resolution. As a result,
identifiers such as "http://example.com/somepath#someFrag" often
take on meaning through the community experience of performing an
HTTP GET request on the identifier and, if given a successful
response, interpreting the response as a representation of the
identified resource. (See also <a class="int" href="#fragid" shape=
"rect">Fragment Identifiers (§2.6)</a>.) Of course, a retrieval
action like GET is not the only way to obtain information about a
resource. One might also publish a document that purports to define
the meaning of a particular URI. These other sources of information
may suggest meanings for such identifiers, but it's a local policy
decision whether those suggestions should be heeded.</p>
<p><a name="p49" id="p49"></a>Just as one might wish to refer to a
person by different names (by full name, first name only, sports
nickname, romantic nickname, and so forth), Web architecture allows
the association of more than one URI with a resource. URIs that
identify the same resource are called <a name="def-uri-aliases" id=
"def-uri-aliases"><dfn>URI aliases</dfn></a>. The section on
<a class="int" href="#uri-aliases" shape="rect">URI aliases (§2.3.1)</a>
discusses some of the potential costs of creating multiple URIs for
the same resource.</p>
<p><a name="p50" id="p50"></a>Several sections of this document
address questions about the relationship between URIs and
resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much can I tell about a resource by inspection of a URI
that identifies it? See the sections on <a class="int" href="#URI-scheme"
shape="rect">URI schemes (§2.4)</a> and <a class="int" href="#uri-opacity"
shape="rect">URI opacity (§2.5)</a>.</li>

<li>Who determines what resource a URI identifies? See the section
on <a class="int" href="#uri-assignment" shape="rect">URI allocation
(§2.2.2)</a>.</li>
<li>Can the resource identified by a URI change over time? See the
sections on <a class="int" href="#URI-persistence" shape="rect">URI persistence
(§3.5.1)</a> and <a class="int" href="#representation-management" shape=
"rect">representation management (§3.5)</a>.</li>
<li>Since more than one URI can identify the same resource, how do
I know which URIs identify the same resource? See the sections on
<a class="int" href="#identifiers-comparison" shape="rect">URI comparison
(§2.3)</a> and <a class="int" href="#future-comparison" shape="rect">assertions
that two URIs identify the same resource (§2.7.2)</a>.</li>

</ul>
<div class="section">
<h4>2.2.1. <a name="URI-collision" id="URI-collision" shape=
"rect">URI collision</a></h4>
<p><a name="p51" id="p51"></a>By design, a URI identifies one
resource. Using the same URI to directly identify different
resources produces a <a name="def-uri-collision" id=
"def-uri-collision"><dfn>URI collision</dfn></a>. Collision often
imposes a cost in communication due to the effort required to
resolve ambiguities.</p>
<p><a name="p52" id="p52"></a>Suppose, for example, that one
organization makes use of a URI to refer to the movie <cite>The
Sting</cite>, and another organization uses the same URI to refer
to a discussion forum about <cite>The Sting</cite>. To a third
party, aware of both organizations, this collision creates
confusion about what the URI identifies, undermining the value of
the URI. If one wanted to talk about the creation date of the
resource identified by the URI, for instance, it would not be clear
whether this meant "when the movie was created" or "when the
discussion forum about the movie was created."</p>
<p><a name="p53" id="p53"></a>Social and technical solutions have
been devised to help avoid URI collision. However, the success or
failure of these different approaches depends on the extent to
which there is consensus in the Internet community on abiding by
the defining specifications.</p>

<p><a name="p54" id="p54"></a>The section on <a class="addrefnb"
href="#uri-assignment" shape="rect">URI allocation (§2.2.2)</a>
examines approaches for establishing the authoritative source of
information about what resource a URI identifies.</p>
<p><a name="p55" id="p55"></a>URIs are sometimes used for <a href=
"#indirect-identification" shape="rect">indirect identification

<div class="section">
<h4>2.2.2. <a name="uri-assignment" id="uri-assignment" shape=

<p><a name="p56" id="p56"></a>URI allocation is the process of
associating a URI with a resource. Allocation can be performed both
by resource owners and by other parties. It is important to avoid

<li>to associate a resource with an owned URI—URI allocation.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="p58" id="p58"></a>By social convention, URI ownership
is delegated from the IANA URI scheme registry [<a href=
"#IANASchemes" shape="rect">IANASchemes</a>], itself a social
entity, to IANA-registered URI scheme specifications. Some URI
scheme specifications further delegate ownership to subordinate
registries or to other nominated owners, who may further delegate
ownership. In the case of a specification, ownership ultimately
lies with the community that maintains the specification.</p>

<p><a name="p59" id="p59"></a>The approach taken for the "http" URI
scheme, for example, follows the pattern whereby the Internet
community delegates authority, via the IANA URI scheme registry and
the DNS, over a set of URIs with a common prefix to one particular
owner. One consequence of this approach is the Web's heavy reliance
on the central DNS registry. A different approach is taken by the
URN Syntax scheme [<a class="int" href="#RFC2141" shape="rect">RFC2141</a>]
which delegates ownership of portions of URN space to URN Namespace
specifications which themselves are registered in an
IANA-maintained registry of URN Namespace Identifiers.</p>
<p><a name="p60" id="p60"></a>URI owners are responsible for
avoiding the assignment of equivalent URIs to multiple resources.
Thus, if a URI scheme specification does provide for the delegation
of individual or organized sets of URIs, it should take pains to
ensure that ownership ultimately resides in the hands of a single
social entity. Allowing multiple owners increases the likelihood of
URI collisions.</p>
<p><a name="p61" id="p61"></a>URI owners may organize or deploy
infrastruture to ensure that representations of associated
resources are available and, where appropriate, interaction with
the resource is possible through the exchange of representations.
There are social expectations for responsible <a class="addrefnb"

might hear a report on Britain that begins, "Today, 10 Downing

Downing Street" identifies the official residence of Britain's
Prime Minister. In this context, the news reporter is using it (as
English rhetoric allows) to indirectly identify the British
government. Similarly, URIs identify resources, but they can also
be used in many constructs to indirectly identify other resources.
Globally adopted assignment policies make some URIs appealing as
general-purpose identifiers. Local policy establishes what they
indirectly identify.</p>
<p><a name="p67" id="p67"></a>Suppose that

naming flexibility) to URI aliases, there are also costs. URI
aliases are harmful when they divide the Web of related resources.
A corollary of Metcalfe's Principle (the "network effect") is that
the value of a given resource can be measured by the number and
value of other resources in its network neighborhood, that is, the
resources that link to it.</p>
<p><a name="p72" id="p72"></a>The problem with aliases is that if
half of the neighborhood points to one URI for a given resource,
and the other half points to a second, different URI for that same
resource, the neighborhood is divided. Not only is the aliased
resource undervalued because of this split, the entire neighborhood
of resources loses value because of the missing second-order
relationships that should have existed among the referring
resources by virtue of their references to the aliased
resource.</p>

<p><a name="p83" id="p83"></a>In the URI
"http://weather.example.com/", the "http" that appears before the
colon (":") names a URI scheme. Each URI scheme has a specification
that explains the scheme-specific details of how scheme identifiers
are allocated and become associated with a resource. The URI syntax
is thus a federated and extensible naming system wherein each
scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and

<p><a name="p85" id="p85"></a>While Web architecture allows the
definition of new schemes, introducing a new scheme is costly. Many
aspects of URI processing are scheme-dependent, and a large amount
of deployed software already processes URIs of well-known schemes.
Introducing a new URI scheme requires the development and
deployment not only of client software to handle the scheme, but
also of ancillary agents such as gateways, proxies, and caches. See

considerations and costs related to URI scheme design.</p>
<p><a name="p86" id="p86"></a>Because of these costs, if a URI

<li>One should not expect that general-purpose software will do
anything useful with URIs of this scheme beyond URI

</ul>
<p><a name="p92" id="p92"></a>One misguided motivation for
registering a new URI scheme is to allow a software agent to launch
a particular application when retrieving a representation. The same
thing can be accomplished at lower expense by dispatching instead
on the type of the representation, thereby allowing use of existing
transfer protocols and implementations.</p>
<p><a name="p93" id="p93"></a>Even if an agent cannot process
representation data in an unknown format, it can at least retrieve
it. The data may contain enough information to allow a user or user
agent to make some use of it. When an agent does not handle a new
URI scheme, it cannot retrieve a representation.</p>
<p><a name="p94" id="p94"></a>When designing a new data format, the
preferred mechanism to promote its deployment on the Web is the
Internet media type (see <a class="int" href="#internet-media-type" shape=

<p><a name="p95" id="p95"></a>It is tempting to guess the nature of
a resource by inspection of a URI that identifies it. However, the
Web is designed so that agents communicate resource information
state through <a class="int" href="#def-representation" shape=

determine the type of a resource representation by inspecting a URI
for that resource. For example, the ".html" at the end of
"http://example.com/page.html" provides no guarantee that
representations of the identified resource will be served with the
Internet media type "text/html". The publisher is free to allocate
identifiers and define how they are served. The HTTP protocol does
not constrain the Internet media type based on the path component
of the URI; the URI owner is free to configure the server to return
a representation using PNG or any other data format.</p>
<p><a name="p96" id="p96"></a>Resource state may evolve over time.
Requiring a URI owner to publish a new URI for each change in

take many forms, including retrieving a representation of the
resource (for instance, by using HTTP GET or HEAD), adding or
modifying a representation of the resource (for instance, by using
HTTP POST or PUT, which in some cases may change the actual state
of the resource if the submitted representations are interpreted as
instructions to that end), and deleting some or all representations
of the resource (for instance, by using HTTP DELETE, which in some
cases may result in the deletion of the resource itself).</p>
<p><a name="p118" id="p118"></a>There may be more than one way to
access a resource for a given URI; application context determines
which access method an agent uses. For instance, a browser might
use HTTP GET to retrieve a representation of a resource, whereas a
hypertext link checker might use HTTP HEAD on the same URI simply
to establish whether a representation is available. Some URI
schemes set expectations about available access methods, others
(such as the URN scheme [<a class="int" href="#RFC2141" shape="rect">RFC
2141</a>]) do not. Section 1.2.2 of [<a class="int" href="#URI" shape=

through gateways, proxies, caches, and name resolution services
that are independent of the protocol associated with the scheme
name.</p>
<p><a name="p120" id="p120"></a>Many URI schemes define a default
interaction protocol for attempting access to the identified
resource. That interaction protocol is often the basis for
allocating identifiers within that scheme, just as "http" URIs are
defined in terms of TCP-based HTTP servers. However, this does not
imply that all interaction with such resources is limited to the
default interaction protocol. For example, information retrieval
systems often make use of proxies to interact with a multitude of
URI schemes, such as HTTP proxies being used to access "ftp" and
"wais" resources. Proxies can also to provide enhanced services,
such as annotation proxies that combine normal information
retrieval with additional metadata retrieval to provide a seamless,
multidimensional view of resources using the same protocols and
user agents as the non-annotated Web. Likewise, future protocols
may be defined that encompass our current systems, using entirely
different interaction mechanisms, without changing the existing
identifier schemes. See also, <a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs" shape=

<h4>3.1.1. <a name="dereference-details" id="dereference-details"
shape="rect">Details of retrieving a representation</a></h4>
<p><a name="p121" id="p121"></a>Dereferencing a URI generally
involves a succession of steps as described in multiple
specifications and implemented by the agent. The following example
illustrates the series of specifications that governs the process
when a user agent is instructed to follow a <a class="int" href="#hypertext"
shape="rect">hypertext link (§4.4)</a> that is part of an SVG
document. In this example, the URI is
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" and the application context
calls for the user agent to retrieve and render a representation of
the identified resource.</p>

<ol>
<li>Since the URI is part of a hypertext link in an SVG document,
the first relevant specification is the SVG 1.1 Recommendation
[<a class="int" href="#SVG11" shape="rect">SVG11</a>]. <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html#Links" shape="rect">Section 17.1</a> of
this specification imports the link semantics defined in XLink 1.0
[<a class="int" href="#XLink10" shape="rect">XLink10</a>]: "The remote resource
(the destination for the link) is defined by a URI specified by the
XLink <code>href</code> attribute on the '<code>a</code>' element."
The SVG specification goes on to state that interpretation of an
<code>a</code> element involves retrieving a representation of a
resource, identified by the <code>href</code> attribute in the
XLink namespace: "By activating these links (by clicking with the
mouse, through keyboard input, voice commands, etc.), users may
visit these resources."</li>

<li>The XLink 1.0 [<a class="int" href="#XLink10" shape="rect">XLink10</a>]
specification, which defines the <code>href</code> attribute in
section 5.4, states that "The value of the href attribute must be a
URI reference as defined in [IETF RFC 2396], or must result in a
URI reference after the escaping procedure described below is
applied."</li>
<li>The URI specification [<a class="int" href="#URI" shape="rect">URI</a>]
states that "Each URI begins with a scheme name that refers to a
specification for assigning identifiers within that scheme." The
URI scheme name in this example is "http".</li>
<li>[<a class="int" href="#IANASchemes" shape="rect">IANASchemes</a>] states
that the "http" scheme is defined by the HTTP/1.1 specification
(RFC 2616 [<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape="rect">RFC2616</a>], section
3.2.2).</li>

<li>In this SVG context, the agent constructs an HTTP GET request
(per section 9.3 of [<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape="rect">RFC2616</a>])
to retrieve the representation.</li>
<li>Section 6 of [<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape="rect">RFC2616</a>]
defines how the server constructs a corresponding response message,
including the 'Content-Type' field.</li>
<li>Section 1.4 of [<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape="rect">RFC2616</a>]
states "HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP
connections." This example addresses neither that step in the
process nor other steps such as Domain Name System
(<acronym>DNS</acronym>) resolution.</li>
<li>The agent interprets the returned representation according to
the data format specification that corresponds to the
representation's <a class="int" href="#internet-media-type" shape=
"rect">Internet Media Type (§3.2)</a> (the value of the HTTP
'Content-Type') in the relevant IANA registry [<a href=
"#MEDIATYPEREG" shape="rect">MEDIATYPEREG</a>].</li>

</ol>
<p><a name="p122" id="p122"></a>Precisely which representation(s)
are retrieved depends on a number of factors, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the URI owner makes available any representations at
all;</li>
<li>Whether the agent making the request has access privileges for
those representations (see the section on <a class="int" href="#id-access"
shape="rect">linking and access control (§3.5.2)</a>);</li>
<li>If the URI owner has provided more than one representation (in
different formats such as HTML, PNG, or RDF; in different languages
such as English and Spanish; or transformed dynamically according
to the hardware or software capabilities of the recipient), the
resulting representation may depend on negotiation between the user
agent and server.</li>
<li>The time of the request; the world changes over time, so
representations of resources are also likely to change over
time.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="p123" id="p123"></a>Assuming that a representation has
been successfully retrieved, the expressive power of the
representation's format will affect how precisely the
representation provider communicates resource state. If the
representation communicates the state of the resource inaccurately,
this inaccuracy or ambiguity may lead to confusion among users
about what the resource is. If different users reach different
conclusions about what the resource is, they may interpret this as
a <a class="int" href="#URI-collision" shape="rect">URI collision (§2.2.1)</a>.
Some communities, such as the ones developing the Semantic Web,
seek to provide a framework for accurately communicating the
semantics of a resource in a machine readable way. Machine readable
semantics may alleviate some of the ambiguity associated with
natural language descriptions of resources.</p>

<p><a name="p125" id="p125"></a>Representations of a resource may
be sent or received using interaction protocols. These protocols in
turn determine the form in which representations are conveyed on
the Web. HTTP, for example, provides for transmission of

[<a class="int" href="#RFC2046" shape="rect">RFC2046</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p126" id="p126"></a>Just as it is important to reuse
existing URI schemes whenever possible, there are significant
benefits to using media typed octet streams for representations
even in the unusual case where a new URI scheme and associated
protocol is to be defined. For example, if the Oaxaca weather were
conveyed to Nadia's browser using a protocol other than HTTP, then
software to render formats such as text/xhmtl+xml and image/png
would still be usable if the new protocol supported transmission of
those types. This is an example of the <a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs"

<div class="story">
<p><a name="p132" id="p132"></a>In one of his XHTML pages, Dirk
creates a hypertext link to an image that Nadia has published on
the Web. He creates a hypertext link with <code>&lt;a
href="http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat"&gt;Nadia's
hat&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Emma views Dirk's XHTML page in her Web
browser and follows the link. The HTML implementation in her
browser removes the fragment from the URI and requests the image
"http://www.example.com/images/nadia". Nadia serves an SVG
representation of the image (with Internet media type
"image/svg+xml"). Emma's Web browser starts up an SVG
implementation to view the image. It passes it the original URI
including the fragment, "http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat"
to this implementation, causing a view of the hat to be displayed
rather than the complete image.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="p133" id="p133"></a>Note that the HTML implementation
in Emma's browser did not need to <em>understand the syntax or
semantics</em> of the SVG fragment (nor does the SVG implementation
have to understand HTML, WebCGM, RDF ... fragment syntax or
semantics; it merely had to recognize the # delimiter from the URI
syntax [URI] and remove the fragment when accessing the resource).
This <a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs" shape="rect">orthogonality
(§5.1)</a> is an important feature of Web architecture; it is what
enabled Emma's browser to provide a useful service without
requiring an upgrade.</p>
<p><a name="p134" id="p134"></a>The semantics of a fragment
identifier are defined by the set of representations that might
result from a retrieval action on the primary resource. The
fragment's format and resolution are therefore dependent on the
type of a potentially retrieved representation, even though such a
retrieval is only performed if the URI is dereferenced. If no such
representation exists, then the semantics of the fragment are
considered unknown and, effectively, unconstrained. Fragment
identifier semantics are orthogonal to URI schemes and thus cannot
be redefined by URI scheme specifications.</p>
<p><a name="p135" id="p135"></a>Interpretation of the fragment
identifier is performed solely by the agent that dereferences a
URI; the fragment identifier is not passed to other systems during
the process of retrieval. This means that some intermediaries in
Web architecture (such as proxies) have no interaction with
fragment identifiers and that redirection (in HTTP [<a href=
"#RFC2616" shape="rect">RFC2616</a>], for example) does not account
for fragments.</p>

<p><a name="p136" id="p136"></a><a name="def-coneg" id=
"def-coneg"><dfn>Content negotiation</dfn></a> refers to the
practice of making available multiple representations via the same
URI. Negotiation between the requesting agent and the server
determines which representation is served (usually with the goal of
serving the "best" representation a receiving agent can process).
HTTP is an example of a protocol that enables representation
providers to use content negotiation.</p>
<p><a name="p137" id="p137"></a>Individual data formats may define
their own rules for use of the fragment identifier syntax for
specifying different types of subsets, views, or external
references that are identifiable as secondary resources by that
media type. Therefore, representation providers must manage content
negotiation carefully when used with a URI that contains a fragment
identifier. Consider an example where the owner of the URI
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca/map#zicatela" uses content
negotiation to serve two representations of the identified
resource. Three situations can arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined consistently by
both data format specifications. The representation provider
decides when definitions of fragment identifier semantics are are
sufficiently consistent.</li>
<li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined inconsistently by
the data format specifications.</li>
<li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined in one data format
specification but not the other.</li>

</ol>
<p><a name="p138" id="p138"></a>The first situation—consistent
semantics—poses no problem.</p>
<p><a name="p139" id="p139"></a>The second case is a server
management error: representation providers must not use content
negotiation to serve representation formats that have inconsistent
fragment identifier semantics. This situation also leads to
<a class="int" href="#URI-collision" shape="rect">URI collision
(§2.2.1)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="p140" id="p140"></a>The third case is not a server
management error. It is a means by which the Web can grow. Because
the Web is a distributed system in which formats and agents are
deployed in a non-uniform manner, Web architecture does not
constrain authors to only use "lowest common denominator" formats.
Content authors may take advantage of new data formats while still
ensuring reasonable backward-compatibility for agents that do not
yet implement them.</p>
<p><a name="p141" id="p141"></a>In case three, behavior by the
receiving agent should vary depending on whether the negotiated
format defines fragment identifier semantics. When a received data
format does not define fragment identifier semantics, the agent
should not perform <a class="int" href="#no-silent-recovery" shape=
"rect">silent error recovery</a> unless the user has given consent;
see [<a class="int" href="#CUAP" shape="rect">CUAP</a>] for additional

Representation Data and Metadata</a></h3>
<p><a name="p143" id="p143"></a>Successful communication between
two parties depends on a reasonably shared understanding of the
semantics of exchanged messages, both data and metadata. At times,
there may be inconsistencies between a message sender's data and
metadata. Examples, observed in practice, of inconsistencies
between representation data and metadata include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual character encoding of a representation (e.g.,
"iso-8859-1", specified by the <code>encoding</code> attribute in
an XML declaration) is inconsistent with the charset parameter in
the representation metadata (e.g., "utf-8", specified by the
'Content-Type' field in an HTTP header).</li>
<li>The <a class="int" href="#xml-namespaces" shape="rect">namespace
(§4.5.3)</a> of the root element of XML representation data (e.g.,
as specified by the "xmlns" attribute) is inconsistent with the
value of the 'Content-Type' field in an HTTP header.</li>

</ul>
<p><a name="p144" id="p144"></a>On the other hand, there is no
inconsistency in serving HTML content with the media type
"text/plain", for example, as this combination is licensed by
specifications.</p>

<p><a name="p148" id="p148"></a>Thus, for example, if the parties
responsible for "weather.example.com" mistakenly label the
satellite photo of Oaxaca as "image/gif" instead of "image/jpeg",
and if Nadia's browser detects a problem, Nadia's browser must not
ignore the problem (e.g., by simply rendering the JPEG image)
without Nadia's consent. Nadia's browser can notify Nadia of the
problem or notify Nadia and take corrective action.</p>

<p><a name="p149" id="p149"></a>Furthermore, representation
providers can help reduce the risk of inconsistencies through
careful assignment of representation metadata (especially that
which applies across representations). The section on <a href=
"#xml-media-types" shape="rect">media types for XML (§4.5.7)</a>
presents an example of reducing the risk of error by providing no
metadata about character encoding when serving XML.</p>
<p><a name="p150" id="p150"></a>The accuracy of metadata relies on
the server administrators, the authors of representations, and the
software that they use. Practically, the capabilities of the tools
and the social relationships may be the limiting factors.</p>
<p><a name="p151" id="p151"></a>The accuracy of these and other
metadata fields is just as important for dynamic Web resources,
where a little bit of thought and programming can often ensure
correct metadata for a huge number of resources.</p>
<p><a name="p152" id="p152"></a>Often there is a separation of
control between the users who create representations of resources
and the server managers who maintain the Web site software. Given
that it is generally the Web site software that provides the
metadata associated with a resource, it follows that coordination
between the server managers and content creators is required.</p>

<h4>3.5.1. <a name="URI-persistence" id="URI-persistence" shape=
"rect">URI persistence</a></h4>
<p><a name="p184" id="p184"></a>As is the case with many human
interactions, confidence in interactions via the Web depends on
stability and predictability. For an information resource,
persistence depends on the consistency of representations. The
representation provider decides when representations are
sufficiently consistent (although that determination generally
takes user expectations into account).</p>
<p><a name="p185" id="p185"></a>Although persistence in this case
is observable as a result of representation retrieval, the term
<a name="def-URI-persistence" id="def-URI-persistence"><dfn>URI
persistence</dfn></a> is used to describe the desirable property
that, once associated with a resource, a URI should continue
indefinitely to refer to that resource.</p>

SHOULD provide representations of the identified resource
consistently and predictably.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p188" id="p188"></a>URI persistence is a matter of
policy and commitment on the part of the <a class="int" href="#uri-ownership"
shape="rect">URI owner</a>. The choice of a particular URI scheme
provides no guarantee that those URIs will be persistent or that
they will not be persistent.</p>
<p><a name="p189" id="p189"></a>HTTP [<a class="int" href="#RFC2616" shape=
"rect">RFC2616</a>] has been designed to help manage URI
persistence. For example, HTTP redirection (using the 3xx response
codes) permits servers to tell an agent that further action needs
to be taken by the agent in order to fulfill the request (for
example, a new URI is associated with the resource).</p>

<p><a name="p190" id="p190"></a> In addition, <a class="int" href="#def-coneg"
shape="rect">content negotiation</a> also promotes consistency, as
a site manager is not required to define new URIs when adding
support for a new format specification. Protocols that do not
support content negotiation (such as FTP) require a new identifier
when a new data format is introduced. Improper use of content
negotiation can lead to inconsistent representations.</p>

<h4>3.5.2. <a name="id-access" id="id-access" shape="rect">Linking

<p><a name="p192" id="p192"></a>It is reasonable to limit access to
a resource (for commercial or security reasons, for example), but
merely identifying the resource is like referring to a book by
title. In exceptional circumstances, people may have agreed to keep
titles or URIs confidential (for example, a book author and a
publisher may agree to keep the URI of page containing additional
material secret until after the book is published), otherwise they
are free to exchange them.</p>

<p><a name="p193" id="p193"></a>As an analogy: The owners of a
building might have a policy that the public may only enter the
building via the main front door, and only during business hours.
People who work in the building and who make deliveries to it might
use other doors as appropriate. Such a policy would be enforced by
a combination of security personnel and mechanical devices such as
locks and pass-cards. One would not enforce this policy by hiding
some of the building entrances, nor by requesting legislation
requiring the use of the front door and forbidding anyone to reveal
the fact that there are other doors to the building.</p>

<p><a name="p200" id="p200"></a>For resources that are generated on
demand, machine generation of URIs is common. For resources that
might usefully be bookmarked for later perusal, or shared with
others, server managers should avoid needlessly restricting the
reusability of such URIs. If the intention is to restrict
information to a particular user, as might be the case in a home
banking application for example, designers should use appropriate

<a class="int" href="#id-access" shape="rect">access control (§3.5.2)</a>
mechanisms.</p>
<p><a name="p201" id="p201"></a>Interactions conducted with HTTP
POST (where HTTP GET could have been used) also limit navigation
possibilities. The user cannot create a bookmark or share the URI
because HTTP POST transactions do not typically result in a
different URI as the user interacts with the site.</p>

<h2>4. <a id="formats" name="formats" shape="rect">Data
Formats</a></h2>
<p><a name="p203" id="p203"></a>A data format specification (for
example, for XHTML, RDF/XML, SMIL, XLink, CSS, and PNG) embodies an
agreement on the correct interpretation of <a href=
"#def-representation" shape="rect">representation</a> data. The
first data format used on the Web was HTML. Since then, data
formats have grown in number. Web architecture does not constrain
which data formats content providers can use. This flexibility is
important because there is constant evolution in applications,
resulting in new data formats and refinements of existing formats.
Although Web architecture allows for the deployment of new data
formats, the creation and deployment of new formats (and agents
able to handle them) is expensive. Thus, before inventing a new
data format (or "meta" format such as XML), designers should
carefully consider re-using one that is already available.</p>
<p><a name="p204" id="p204"></a>For a data format to be usefully
interoperable between two parties, the parties must agree (to a
reasonable extent) about its syntax and semantics. Shared
understanding of a data format promotes interoperability but does
not imply constraints on usage; for instance, a sender of data
cannot count on being able to constrain the behavior of a data
receiver.</p>
<p><a name="p205" id="p205"></a>Below we describe some
characteristics of a data format that facilitate integration into
Web architecture. This document does not address generally
beneficial characteristics of a specification such as readability,
simplicity, attention to programmer goals, attention to user needs,
accessibility, nor internationalization. The section on <a href=
"#archspecs" shape="rect">architectural specifications (§7.1)</a>
includes references to additional format specification
guidelines.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>4.1. <a name="binary" id="binary" shape="rect">Binary and
Textual Data Formats</a></h3>
<p><a name="p206" id="p206"></a>Binary data formats are those in
which portions of the data are encoded for direct use by computer
processors, for example 32 bit little-endian two's-complement and
64 bit IEEE double-precision floating-point. The portions of data
so represented include numeric values, pointers, and compressed
data of all sorts.</p>
<p><a name="p207" id="p207"></a>A textual data format is one in
which the data is specified in a defined encoding as a sequence of
characters. HTML, Internet e-mail, and all <a class="int" href="#xml-formats"
shape="rect">XML-based formats (§4.5)</a> are textual.
Increasingly, internationalized textual data formats refer to the
Unicode repertoire [<a class="int" href="#UNICODE" shape="rect">UNICODE</a>]
for character definitions.</p>
<p><a name="p208" id="p208"></a>If a data format is textual, as
defined in this section, that does not imply that it should be
served with a media type beginning with "text/". Although XML-based
formats are textual, many XML-based formats do not consist
primarily of phrases in natural language. See the section on
<a class="int" href="#xml-media-types" shape="rect">media types for XML
(§4.5.7)</a> for issues that arise when "text/" is used in
conjunction with an XML-based format.</p>

<p><a name="p209" id="p209"></a>In principle, all data can be
represented using textual formats. In practice, some types of
content (e.g., audio and video) are generally represented using
binary formats.</p>
<p><a name="p210" id="p210"></a>The trade-offs between binary and
textual data formats are complex and application-dependent. Binary
formats can be substantially more compact, particularly for complex
pointer-rich data structures. Also, they can be consumed more
rapidly by agents in those cases where they can be loaded into
memory and used with little or no conversion. Note, however, that
such cases are relatively uncommon as such direct use may open the
door to security issues that can only practically be addressed by
examining every aspect of the data structure in detail.</p>
<p><a name="p211" id="p211"></a>Textual formats are usually more
portable and interoperable. Textual formats also have the
considerable advantage that they can be directly read by human
beings (and understood, given sufficient documentation). This can
simplify the tasks of creating and maintaining software, and allow
the direct intervention of humans in the processing chain without
recourse to tools more complex than the ubiquitous text editor.
Finally, it simplifies the necessary human task of learning about
new data formats; this is called the "view source" effect.</p>
<p><a name="p212" id="p212"></a>It is important to emphasize that
intuition as to such matters as data size and processing speed is
not a reliable guide in data format design; quantitative studies
are essential to a correct understanding of the trade-offs.
Therefore, designers of a data format specification should make a
considered choice between binary and textual format design.</p>

<h3>4.2. <a name="ext-version" id="ext-version" shape=

<p><a name="p214" id="p214"></a>In a perfect world, language
designers would invent languages that perfectly met the
requirements presented to them, the requirements would be a perfect
model of the world, they would never change over time, and all
implementations would be perfectly interoperable because the
specifications would have no variability.</p>
<p><a name="p215" id="p215"></a>In the real world, language
designers imperfectly address the requirements as they interpret
them, the requirements inaccurately model the world, conflicting
requirements are presented, and they change over time. As a result,
designers negotiate with users, make compromises, and often
introduce extensibility mechanisms so that it is possible to work
around problems in the short term. In the long term, they produce
multiple versions of their languages, as the problem, and their
understanding of it, evolve. The resulting variability in
specifications, languages, and implementations introduces
interoperability costs.</p>
<p><a name="p216" id="p216"></a>Extensibility and versioning are
strategies to help manage the natural evolution of information on
the Web and technologies used to represent that information. For

<div class="story">
<p><a name="p222" id="p222"></a>Nadia and Dirk are designing an XML
data format to encode data about the film industry. They provide
for extensibility by using XML namespaces and creating a schema
that allows the inclusion, in certain places, of elements from any
namespace. When they revise their format, Nadia proposes a new
optional <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>film</code>
element. Dirk feels that such a change requires them to assign a
new namespace name, which might require changes to deployed
software. Nadia explains to Dirk that their choice of extensibility
strategy in conjunction with their namespace policy allows certain
changes that do not affect conformance of existing content and
software, and thus no change to the namespace identifier is
required. They chose this policy to help them meet their goals of
reducing the cost of change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="p223" id="p223"></a>Dirk and Nadia have chosen a
particular namespace change policy that allows them to avoid
changing the namespace name whenever they make changes that do not
affect conformance of deployed content and software. They might
have chosen a different policy, for example that any new element or
attribute has to belong to a namespace other than the original one.
Whatever the chosen policy, it should set clear expectations for
users of the format.</p>
<p><a name="p224" id="p224"></a>In general, changing the namespace
name of an element completely changes the element name. If "a" and
"b" are bound to two different URIs, <code>a:element</code> and

<code>b:element</code> are as distinct as <code>a:eieio</code> and
<code>a:xyzzy</code>. Practically speaking, this means that
deployed applications will have to be upgraded in order to
recognize the new language; the cost of this upgrade may be very
high.</p>
<p><a name="p225" id="p225"></a>It follows that there are
significant tradeoffs to be considered when deciding on a namespace
change policy. If a vocabulary has no extensibility points (that
is, if it does not allow elements or attributes from foreign
namespaces or have a mechanism for dealing with unrecognized names
from the same namespace), it may be absolutely necessary to change
the namespace name. Languages that allow some form of extensibility
without requiring a change to the namespace name are more likely to
evolve gracefully.</p>

the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/nsuri" shape="rect">W3C
namespace policy</a> for documents on the W3C Recommendation track.
The policy sets expectations that the Working Group responsible for
the namespace may modify it in any way until a certain point in the
process ("Candidate Recommendation") at which point W3C constrains
the set of possible changes to the namespace in order to promote
stable implementations.</p>
<p><a name="p229" id="p229"></a>Note that since namespace names are
URIs, the owner of a namespace URI has the authority to decide the
namespace change policy.</p>

<p><a name="p230" id="p230"></a>Requirements change over time.
Successful technologies are adopted and adapted by new users.
Designers can facilitate the transition process by making careful
choices about extensibility during the design of a language or
protocol specification.</p>
<p><a name="p231" id="p231"></a>In making these choices, the
designers must weigh the trade-offs between extensibility,
simplicity, and variability. A language without extensibility
mechanisms may be simpler and less variable, improving initial
interoperability. However, it's likely that changes to that
language will be more difficult, possibly more complex and more
variable, than if the initial design had provided such mechanisms.
This may decrease interoperability over the long term.</p>

<li>"Must understand": The agent treats unrecognized markup as an

</ol>
<p><a name="p241" id="p241"></a>A powerful design approach is for
the language to allow either form of extension, but to distinguish
explicitly between them in the syntax.</p>
<p><a name="p242" id="p242"></a>Additional strategies include
prompting the user for more input and automatically retrieving data
from available hypertext links. More complex strategies are also
possible, including mixing strategies. For instance, a language can
include mechanisms for overriding standard behavior. Thus, a data
format can specify "must ignore" semantics but also allow for
extensions that override that semantics in light of application
needs (for instance, with "must understand" semantics for a
particular extension).</p>
<p><a name="p243" id="p243"></a>Extensibility is not free.
Providing hooks for extensibility is one of many requirements to be

<p><a name="p245" id="p245"></a>Many modern data format include
mechanisms for composition. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to embed text comments in some image formats,
such as JPEG/JFIF. Although these comments are embedded in the
containing data, they are not intended to affect the display of the
image.</li>
<li>There are container formats such as SOAP which fully expect
content from multiple namespaces but which provide an overall
semantic relationship of message envelope and payload.</li>
<li>The semantics of combining RDF documents containing multiple
vocabularies are well-defined.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="p246" id="p246"></a>In principle, these relationships
can be mixed and nested arbitrarily. A SOAP message, for example,
can contain an SVG image that contains an RDF comment which refers
to a vocabulary of terms for describing the image.</p>
<p><a name="p247" id="p247"></a>Note however, that for general XML
there is no semantic model that defines the interactions within XML
documents with elements and/or attributes from a variety of
namespaces. Each application must define how namespaces interact
and what effect the namespace of an element has on the element's
ancestors, siblings, and descendants.</p>

<h3>4.3. <a name="pci" id="pci" shape="rect">Separation of Content,
Presentation, and Interaction</a></h3>

<p><a name="p249" id="p249"></a>The Web is a heterogeneous
environment where a wide variety of agents provide access to
content to users with a wide variety of capabilities. It is good
practice for authors to create content that can reach the widest
possible audience, including users with graphical desktop
computers, hand-held devices and mobile phones, users with
disabilities who may require speech synthesizers, and devices not
yet imagined. Furthermore, authors cannot predict in some cases how
an agent will display or process their content. Experience shows
that the separation of content, presentation, and interaction
promotes the reuse and device-independence of content; this follows
from the <a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs" shape="rect">principle of
orthogonal specifications (§5.1)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="p250" id="p250"></a>This separation also facilitates
reuse of authored source content across multiple delivery contexts.
Sometimes, functional user experiences suited to any delivery
context can be generated by using an adaptation process applied to
a representation that does not depend on the access mechanism. For

<p><a name="p253" id="p253"></a>Note that when content,
presentation, and interaction are separated by design, agents need
to recombine them. There is a recombination spectrum, with "client
does all" at one end and "server does all" at the other.</p>
<p><a name="p254" id="p254"></a>There are advantages to each
approach. For instance when a client (such as a mobile phone)
communicates device capabilities to the server (for example, using
CC/PP), the server can tailor the delivered content to fit that
client. The server can, for example, enable faster downloads by
adjusting links to refer to lower resolution images, smaller video
or no video at all. Similarly, if the content has been authored
with multiple branches, the server can remove unused branches
before delivery. In addition, by tailoring the content to match the
characteristics of a target client, the server can help reduce
client side computation. However, specializing content in this
manner reduces caching efficiency.</p>
<p><a name="p255" id="p255"></a>On the other hand, designing
content that that can be recombined on the client also tends to
make that content applicable to a wider range of devices. This
design also improves caching efficiency and offers users more
presentation options. Media-dependent style sheets can be used to
tailor the content on the client side to particular groups of
target devices. For textual content with a regular and repeating
structure, the combined size of the text content plus the style
sheet is typically less than that of fully recombined content; the
savings improve further if the style sheet is reused by other
pages.</p>
<p><a name="p256" id="p256"></a>In practice a combination of both
approaches is often used. The design decision about where on this
spectrum an application should be placed depends on the power on
the client, the power and the load on the server, and the bandwidth
of the medium that connects them. If the number of possible clients
is unbounded, the application will scale better if more computation
is pushed to the client.</p>
<p><a name="p257" id="p257"></a>Of course, it may not be desirable
to reach the widest possible audience. Designers should consider
appropriate technologies, such as encryption and <a href=
"#id-access" shape="rect">access control (§3.5.2)</a>, for limiting
the audience.</p>
<p><a name="p258" id="p258"></a>Some data formats are designed to
describe presentation (including SVG and XSL Formatting Objects).
Data formats such as these demonstrate that one can only separate
content from presentation (or interaction) so far; at some point it
becomes necessary to talk about presentation. Per the principle of
<a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs" shape="rect">orthogonal specifications
(§5.1)</a> these data formats should <em>only</em> address
presentation issues.</p>

<p><a name="p260" id="p260"></a>A defining characteristic of the
Web is that it allows embedded references to other resources via
URIs. The simplicity of creating hypertext links using absolute
URIs (<code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/foo"&gt;</code>) and
relative URI references (<code>&lt;a href="foo"&gt;</code> and

<code>&lt;a href="foo#anchor"&gt;</code>) is partly (perhaps
largely) responsible for the success of the hypertext Web as we
know it today.</p>
<p><a name="p261" id="p261"></a>When a representation of one
resource contains a reference to another resource, expressed with a
URI identifying that other resource, this constitutes a <a name=

resources. Additional metadata may also form part of the link (see
[<a class="int" href="#XLink10" shape="rect">XLink10</a>], for example).

<li>Need for a wide range of tools on a variety of platforms.</li>

way that makes confusion over coding options unlikely.</li>

[<a class="int" href="#XLink10" shape="rect">XLink</a>] is an appropriate

<h4>4.5.3. <a name="xml-namespaces" id="xml-namespaces" shape=
"rect">XML namespaces</a></h4>
<p><a name="p281" id="p281"></a>The purpose of an XML namespace
(defined in [<a class="int" href="#XMLNS" shape="rect">XMLNS</a>]) is to allow
the deployment of XML vocabularies (in which element and attribute
names are defined) in a global environment and to reduce the risk
of name collisions in a given document when vocabularies are
combined. For example, the MathML and SVG specifications both
define the <code>set</code> element. Although XML data from
different formats such as MathML and SVG can be combined in a
single document, in this case there could be ambiguity about which
<code>set</code> element was intended. XML namespaces reduce the
risk of name collisions by taking advantage of existing systems for
allocating globally scoped names: the URI system (see also the
section on <a class="addrefnb" href="#uri-assignment" shape=
"rect">URI allocation (§2.2.2)</a>). When using XML namespaces,
each local name in an XML vocabulary is paired with a URI (called
the namespace URI) to distinguish the local name from local names
in other vocabularies.</p>
<p><a name="p282" id="p282"></a> The use of URIs confers additional
benefits. First, each URI/local name pair can be mapped to another
URI, grounding the terms of the vocabulary in the Web. These terms
may be important resources and thus it is appropriate to be able to
associate URIs with them.</p>

<p><a name="p283" id="p283"></a>[<a class="int" href="#RDFXML" shape=
"rect">RDFXML</a>] uses simple concatenation of the namespace URI
and the local name to create a URI for the identified term. Other
mappings are likely to be more suitable for hierarchical
namespaces; see the related TAG issue <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#abstractComponentRefs-37"
shape="rect">abstractComponentRefs-37</a>.</p>
<p><a name="p284" id="p284"></a>Designers of XML-based data formats
who declare namespaces thus make it possible to reuse those data
formats and combine them in novel ways not yet imagined. Failure to
declare namespaces makes such reuse more difficult, even
impractical in some cases.</p>

<p class="practice"><a name="p286" id="p286"></a> A specification
that establishes an XML vocabulary SHOULD place all element names
and global attribute names in a namespace.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p287" id="p287"></a>Attributes are always scoped by the
element on which they appear. An attribute that is "global," that
is, one that might meaningfully appear on elements of many types,
including elements in other namespaces, should be explicitly placed
in a namespace. Local attributes, ones associated with only a
particular element type, need not be included in a namespace since
their meaning will always be clear from the context provided by
that element.</p>
<p><a name="p288" id="p288"></a>The <code>type</code> attribute
from the W3C XML Schema Instance namespace
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ([<a class="int" href="#XMLSCHEMA"
shape="rect">XMLSCHEMA</a>], section 4.3.2) is an example of a
global attribute. It can be used by authors of any vocabulary to
make an assertion in instance data about the type of the element on
which it appears. As a global attribute, it must always be
qualified. The <code>frame</code> attribute on an HTML table is an
example of a local attribute. There is no value in placing that
attribute in a namespace since the attribute is unlikely to be
useful on an element other than an HTML table.</p>
<p><a name="p289" id="p289"></a>Applications that rely on DTD
processing must impose additional constraints on the use of
namespaces. DTDs perform validation based on the lexical form of
the element and attribute names in the document. This makes
prefixes syntactically significant in ways that are not anticipated
by [<a class="int" href="#XMLNS" shape="rect">XMLNS</a>].</p>

<p><a name="p292" id="p292"></a>Another benefit of using URIs to
build XML namespaces is that the namespace URI can be used to

This type of information resource is called a <a name="def-ns-doc"
id="def-ns-doc"><dfn>namespace document</dfn></a>. When a namespace
URI owner provides a namespace document, it is authoritative for
the namespace.</p>

<p><a name="p293" id="p293"></a>There are many reasons to provide a
namespace document. A person might want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the purpose of the namespace,</li>
<li>learn how to use the markup vocabulary in the namespace,</li>
<li>find out who controls it and associated policies,</li>
<li>request authority to access schemas or collateral material

<p><a name="p295" id="p295"></a>In general, there is no established

<p><a name="p300" id="p300"></a>Section 3 of "Namespaces in XML"
[<a class="int" href="#XMLNS" shape="rect">XMLNS</a>] provides a syntactic
construct known as a QName for the compact expression of qualified
names in XML documents. A qualified name is a pair consisting of a
URI, which names a namespace, and a local name placed within that
namespace. "Namespaces in XML" provides for the use of QNames as
names for XML elements and attributes.</p>
<p><a name="p301" id="p301"></a>Other specifications, starting with
[<a class="int" href="#XSLT10" shape="rect">XSLT10</a>], have employed the idea
of using QNames in contexts other than element and attribute names,
for example in attribute values and in element content. However,
general XML processors cannot reliably recognize QNames as such
when they are used in attribute values and in element content; for
example, the syntax of QNames overlaps with that of URIs.
Experience has also revealed other limitations to QNames, such as
losing namespace bindings after XML canonicalization.</p>

this usage has a cost. There is no single, accepted way to convert

<p><a name="p310" id="p310"></a>Consider the following fragment of
XML: <code>&lt;section name="foo"&gt;</code>. Does the
<code>section</code> element have what the XML Recommendation
refers to as the ID <code>foo</code> (i.e., "foo" must not appear
in the surrounding XML document more than once)? One cannot answer
this question by examining the element and its attributes alone. In
XML, the quality of "being an ID" is associated with the type of an
attribute, not its name. Finding the IDs in a document requires
additional processing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Processing the document with a processor that recognizes DTD
attribute list declarations (in the external or internal subset)
might reveal a declaration that identifies the <code>name</code>

attribute as an ID. <strong>Note:</strong> This processing is not
necessarily part of validation. A non-validating, DTD-aware
processor can recognize IDs.</li>
<li>Processing the document with a W3C XML schema might reveal an
element declaration that identifies the <code>name</code> attribute
as an W3C XML Schema <code>ID</code>.</li>
<li>In practice, processing the document with another schema
language, such as RELAX NG [<a class="int" href="#RELAXNG" shape=
"rect">RELAXNG</a>], might reveal the attributes declared to be of
ID in the XML Schema sense. Many modern specifications begin
processing XML at the Infoset [<a class="int" href="#INFOSET" shape=
"rect">INFOSET</a>] level and do not specify normatively how an
Infoset is constructed. For those specifications, any process that
establishes the ID type in the Infoset (and Post Schema Validation
Infoset (<acronym>PSVI</acronym>) defined in [<a class="int" href="#XMLSCHEMA"
shape="rect">XMLSCHEMA</a>]) may usefully identify the attributes
of type ID.</li>

<li>In practice, applications may have independent means (such as
those defined in the XPointer specification, [<a class="int" href="#XPTRFR"
shape="rect">XPTRFR</a>] <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/#shorthand"

</ol>
<p><a name="p311" id="p311"></a>To further complicate matters, DTDs
establish the ID type in the Infoset whereas W3C XML Schema

IDs.</p>

<p><a name="p320" id="p320"></a>The section on <a href=
"#media-type-fragid" shape="rect">media types and fragment
identifier semantics (§3.2.1)</a> discusses the interpretation of
fragment identifiers. Designers of an XML-based data format
specification should define the semantics of fragment identifiers
in that format. The XPointer Framework [<a class="int" href="#XPTRFR" shape=
"rect">XPTRFR</a>] provides an interoperable starting point.</p>
<p><a name="p321" id="p321"></a>When the media type assigned to
representation data is "application/xml", there are no semantics
defined for fragment identifiers, and authors should not make use
of fragment identifiers in such data. The same is true if the
assigned media type has the suffix "+xml" (defined in "XML Media
Types" [<a class="int" href="#RFC3023" shape="rect">RFC3023</a>]), and the data
format specification does not specify fragment identifier
semantics. In short, just knowing that content is XML does not
provide information about fragment identifier semantics.</p>
<p><a name="p322" id="p322"></a>Many people assume that the
fragment identifier <code>#abc</code>, when referring to XML data,
identifies the element in the document with the ID "abc". However,
there is no normative support for this assumption. A revision of
RFC 3023 is expected to address this.</p>

<h2>5. <a name="general" id="general" shape="rect">General
Architecture Principles</a></h2>
<p><a name="p325" id="p325"></a>A number of general architecture
principles apply to all three bases of Web architecture.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3>5.1. <a id="orthogonal-specs" name="orthogonal-specs" shape=
"rect">Orthogonal Specifications</a></h3>
<p><a name="p326" id="p326"></a>Identification, interaction, and
representation are orthogonal concepts, meaning that technologies
used for identification, interaction, and representation may evolve
independently. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources are identified with URIs. URIs can be published
without building any representations of the resource or determining
whether any representations are available.</li>
<li>A generic URI syntax allows agents to function in many cases
without knowing specifics of URI schemes.</li>

<li>In many cases one may change the representation of a resource
without disrupting references to the resource (for example, by
using <a class="int" href="#def-coneg" shape="rect">content
negotiation</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="p327" id="p327"></a>When two specifications are
orthogonal, one may change one without requiring changes to the
other, even if one has dependencies on the other. For example,
although the HTTP specification depends on the URI specification,
the two may evolve independently. This orthogonality increases the
flexibility and robustness of the Web. For example, one may refer
by URI to an image without knowing anything about the format chosen
to represent the image. This has facilitated the introduction of
image formats such as PNG and SVG without disrupting existing
references to image resources.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">

<p class="principle"><a name="p329" id="p329"></a> Orthogonal
abstractions benefit from orthogonal specifications.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p330" id="p330"></a>Experience demonstrates that
problems arise where orthogonal concepts occur in a single
specification. Consider, for example, the HTML specification which
includes the orthogonal x-www-form-urlencoded specification.
Software developers (for example, of [<a class="int" href="#CGI" shape=
"rect">CGI</a>] applications) might have an easier time finding the
specification if it were published separately and then cited from
the HTTP, URI, and HTML specifications.</p>

<p><a name="p331" id="p331"></a>Problems also arise when
specifications attempt to modify orthogonal abstractions described
elsewhere. An <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/global.html"
shape="rect">historical version</a> of the HTML specification added
a "<code>Refresh</code>" value to the <code>http-equiv</code>
attribute of the <code>meta</code> element. It was defined to be
equivalent to the HTTP header of the same name. The authors of the
HTTP specification ultimately decided not to provide this header
and that made the two specifications awkwardly at odds with each
other. The W3C HTML Working Group eventually removed the
"<code>Refresh</code>" value.</p>
<p><a name="p332" id="p332"></a>A specification should clearly
indicate which features overlap with those governed by another
specification.</p>

<h3>5.2. <a id="language-extensibility" name=
"language-extensibility" shape="rect">Extensibility</a></h3>
<p><a name="p333" id="p333"></a>The information in the Web and the
technologies used to represent that information change over time.
Extensibility is the property of a technology that promotes
evolution without sacrificing interoperability. Some examples of
successful technologies designed to allow change while minimizing
disruption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fact that URI schemes are orthogonally specified;</li>
<li>the use of an open set of Internet media types in mail and HTTP
to specify document interpretation;</li>
<li>the separation of the generic XML grammar and the open set of
XML namespaces for element and attribute names;</li>
<li>extensibility models in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), XSLT 1.0,
and SOAP;</li>
<li>user agent plug-ins.</li>

</ul>
<p><a name="p334" id="p334"></a>An example of an unsuccessful
extension mechanism is HTTP mandatory extensions [<a href=
"#HTTPEXT" shape="rect">HTTPEXT</a>]. The community has sought
mechanisms to extend HTTP, but apparently the costs of the
mandatory extension proposal (notably in complexity) outweighed the
benefits and thus hampered adoption.</p>
<p><a name="p335" id="p335"></a>Below we discuss the property of
"extensibility," exhibited by URIs, some data formats, and some
protocols (through the incorporation of new messages).</p>
<p><a name="p336" id="p336"></a><a name="def-lang-subset" id=
"def-lang-subset"><dfn>Subset language</dfn></a>: one language is a
subset (or "profile") of a second language if any document in the
first language is also a valid document in the second language and
has the same interpretation in the second language.</p>
<p><a name="p337" id="p337"></a><a name="def-lang-extended" id=
"def-lang-extended"><dfn>Extended language</dfn></a>: If one
language is a subset of another, the latter superset is called an
extended language; the difference between the languages is called
the extension. Clearly, extending a language is better for
interoperability than creating an incompatible language.</p>
<p><a name="p338" id="p338"></a>Ideally, many instances of a
superset language can be safely and usefully processed as though
they were in the subset language. Languages that can evolve this
way, allowing applications to provide new information when
necessary while still interoperating with applications that only
understand a subset of the current language, are said to be
"extensible." Language designers can facilitate extensibility by
defining the default behavior of unknown extensions—for example,
that they be ignored (in some defined way) or should be considered
errors.</p>
<p><a name="p339" id="p339"></a>For example, from early on in the
Web, HTML agents followed the convention of ignoring unknown tags.
This choice left room for innovation (i.e., non-standard elements)
and encouraged the deployment of HTML. However, interoperability
problems arose as well. In this type of environment, there is an
inevitable tension between interoperability in the short term and
the desire for extensibility. Experience shows that designs that
strike the right balance between allowing change and preserving
interoperability are more likely to thrive and are less likely to
disrupt the Web community. <a class="int" href="#orthogonal-specs" shape=

<h3>5.3. <a id="error-handling" name="error-handling" shape=
"rect">Error Handling</a></h3>
<p><a name="p341" id="p341"></a>Errors occur in networked
information systems. An error condition can be well-characterized
(e.g., well-formedness errors in XML or 4xx client errors in HTTP)
or arise unpredictably. <a name="def-error-correction" id=
"def-error-correction"><dfn>Error correction</dfn></a> means that
an agent repairs a condition so that within the system, it is as
though the error never occurred. One example of error correction
involves data retransmission in response to a temporary network
failure. <a name="def-error-recovery" id=
"def-error-recovery"><dfn>Error recovery</dfn></a> means that an
agent does not repair an error condition but continues processing
by addressing the fact that the error has occurred.</p>

<p><a name="p342" id="p342"></a>Agents frequently <em>correct</em>
errors without user awareness, sparing users the details of complex
network communications. On the other hand, it is important that
agents <em>recover</em> from error in a way that is evident to
users, since the agents are acting on their behalf.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><a name="p343" id="p343"></a> <span class=
"principlelab">Principle: <a name="no-silent-recovery" id=
"no-silent-recovery" shape="rect">Error recovery</a></span></p>
<p class="principle"><a name="p344" id="p344"></a> Agents that
recover from error by making a choice without the user's consent
are not acting on the user's behalf.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p345" id="p345"></a>An agent is not required to
interrupt the user (e.g., by popping up a confirmation box) to
obtain consent. The user may indicate consent through pre-selected
configuration options, modes, or selectable user interface toggles,
with appropriate reporting to the user when the agent detects an
error. Agent developers should not ignore usability issues when
designing error recovery behavior.</p>
<p><a name="p346" id="p346"></a>To promote interoperability,
specification designers should identify predictable error
conditions. Experience has led to the following observations about
error-handling approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protocol designers should provide enough information about an
error condition so that an agent can address the error condition.
For instance, an HTTP 404 status code (not found) is useful because
it allows user agents to present relevant information to users,
enabling them to contact the representation provider in case of
problems.</li>
<li>Experience with the cost of building a user agent to handle the
diverse forms of ill-formed HTML content convinced the designers of
the XML specification to require that agents fail upon encountering
ill-formed content. Because users are unlikely to tolerate such
failures, this design choice has pressured all parties into
respecting XML's constraints, to the benefit of all.</li>
<li>An agent that encounters unrecognized content may handle it in
a number of ways, including by considering it an error; see also
the section on <a class="addrefnb" href="#ext-version" shape=
"rect">extensibility and versioning (§4.2)</a>.</li>
<li>Error behavior that is appropriate for a person may not be
appropriate for software. People are capable of exercising
judgement in ways that software applications generally cannot. An
informal error response may suffice for a person but not for a
processor.</li>

<h3>5.4. <a id="protocol-interop" name="protocol-interop" shape=
"rect">Protocol-based Interoperability</a></h3>
<p><a name="p348" id="p348"></a>The Web follows Internet tradition
in that its important interfaces are defined in terms of protocols,
by specifying the syntax, semantics, and sequencing constraints of
the messages interchanged. Protocols designed to be resilient in
the face of widely varying environments have helped the Web scale
and have facilitated communication across multiple trust
boundaries. Traditional application programming interfaces
(<acronym>APIs</acronym>) do not always take these constraints into
account, nor should they be required to. One effect of
protocol-based design is that the technology shared among agents
often lasts longer than the agents themselves.</p>
<p><a name="p349" id="p349"></a>It is common for programmers
working with the Web to write code that generates and parses these
messages directly. It is less common, but not unusual, for end
users to have direct exposure to these messages. It is often
desirable to provide users with access to format and protocol
details: allowing them to “view source,” whereby they may gain
expertise in the workings of the underlying system.</p>
