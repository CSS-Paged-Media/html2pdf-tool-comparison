## ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Nice that you are here!

On this website, I show you the rendering results of different html2pdf tools.

## ðŸ”¬ Test Sections
<div class="boxes"><a href="/CSS-Properties/">CSS Properties</a>
<a href="/CSS-Selectors/">CSS Selectors</a>
<a href="/Paged-Media/">Paged Media</a>
<a href="/Vendor-Samples/">Vendor Samples</a>
</div>

## ðŸ”¬ Test Conditions

For all tests, each tool uses the exact same HTML and CSS input. I do not set any special options the tools might offer, instead I use the most basic call to render a PDF (with external resources).

For the rendering with Prince and PDFreactor, I use free personal licenses. That's why PDFs generated with these tools have a small logo on the top right corner of each page.
